# spoilers (NEEDS NETWORKMANAGER ON LINUX!)
Blocks internet access to help you Solve Competitive Programming Problems on Linux

# Note
You will need NetworkManager. `ncmli` should already be preinstalled!
Hopefully in the future this script can be updated to support
other platforms.

Also, if you want to use the Text to Speech feature for annoucements,
`espeak` should be installed.
