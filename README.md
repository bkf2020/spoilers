# spoilers (NEEDS DIALOG + NETWORKMANAGER)
Blocks internet access to help you Solve Competitive Programming Problems on Unix

# What you need to install

**TL;DR**: dialog and NetworkManager are needed for the script. espeak is optional
and is used for text to speech.

You will need `dialog` for the script to be able to show the prompts. This is probably
already installed, but some operating systems don't ship with this.

Next, you will need NetworkManager. `ncmli` should be installed
after you install NetworkManager. Hopefully in the future this
script can be updated to support other platforms.

Also, if you want to use the Text to Speech feature for annoucements,
`espeak` should be installed.
